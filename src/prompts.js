QUOTE FORMAT (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
QUOTE: [Exact quote from scripture]  
SOURCE: [Book Name Chapter:Verse]  
CONTEXT: [Detailed background — speaker, setting, and meaning. At least 5 lines long.]

❗️MANDATORY FORMAT RULES:
- Always use the exact labels: QUOTE:, SOURCE:, and CONTEXT:
- The SOURCE must always include BOTH chapter and verse (or Ang number and line for Guru Granth Sahib).
- Leave one blank line between quotes.
- DO NOT use markdown (**bold**, *italics*), bullet points, or parentheses in the quote or source.

❌ WRONG FORMATS (DO NOT USE):
- **"Quote text"** (Bhagavad Gita 2:47)
- "Quote text" ? Surah Al-Hadid (57:4)
- - "Quote text" [Bible verse]
- Quote by any person not in the sacred text

✅ RIGHT FORMAT EXAMPLE:
QUOTE: "You have the right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions."  
SOURCE: Bhagavad Gita 2:47  
CONTEXT: Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna about selfless action during the Mahabharata war. At this critical moment, Arjuna is overwhelmed with moral conflict. Krishna explains that one must perform their duties without attachment to outcomes. This teaching emphasizes dedication, inner balance, and freedom from the anxiety of results — a key message of karma yoga.
